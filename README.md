# FoodMenu
Full stack personal dev - Python, Django, JQuery, Bootstrap, Stripe, Heroku, etc.

Dir structure for install is under c:\DJ2

Restaurant website created to manage own menu for ordering.

Actual website is https://www.crv19.com/ using wix.  I wanted to see if I can do my own from the ground up so hence this repo.

Enjoy!
